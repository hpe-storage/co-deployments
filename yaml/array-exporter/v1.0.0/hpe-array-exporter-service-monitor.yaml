# A Service Monitor can enable a Prometheus Operator within the cluster
# to discover the HPE Storage Array Exporter for Prometheus as a scrape
# target.
#
# Modify this sample file to:
# - Match the namespace of the hpe-array-exporter-service
# - Match the selector used by the Prometheus Operator installation
# - Customize the scrape configuration, including desired target labels
