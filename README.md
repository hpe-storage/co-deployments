# Container orchestrator (CO) deployment declarations
This repository contains the source declarations to deploy CO drivers (CSI and FlexVolume) for HPE storage platforms.

## Using Helm
[Helm](https://helm.sh) is the recommended way to deploy both the FlexVolume and CSI driver for HPE storage products.

- Deploy the [HPE FlexVolume Driver for Kubernetes](helm/charts/hpe-flexvolume-driver)
- Deploy the [HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes](helm/charts/hpe-csi-driver)

## DIY with your CO of choice
We provide the [raw YAML files](yaml) to deploy the [HPE CSI Driver](https://github.com/hpe-storage/csi-driver) with the respective [Container Storage Provider](https://github.com/hpe-storage/container-storage-provider) (CSP). These files are usually referenced elsewhere on how to get a particular setup up and running. We recommend using the [Helm charts](helm/charts) first and foremost.

- YAML files for the [HPE FlexVolume Driver for Kubernetes](yaml/flexvolume-driver)
- YAML files for the [HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes](yaml/csi-driver)
