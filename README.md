# Container orchestrator (CO) deployment declarations

This repository contains the source declarations to deploy CO drivers (CSI and FlexVolume) for HPE storage platforms.

## Using Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is the recommended way to deploy both the CSI and FlexVolume driver for HPE storage products.

- Deploy the [HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes](helm/charts/hpe-csi-driver)
- Deploy the [HPE FlexVolume Driver for Kubernetes](helm/charts/hpe-flexvolume-driver)

The Helm chart is also rendered on [ArtifactHub.io](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/hpe-storage/hpe-csi-driver).

## Using Helm Operator

Deploy both the CSI driver and FlexVolume for HPE storage products using Helm Operators

- Deploy the [HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes](operators/hpe-csi-operator)
- Deploy the [HPE FlexVolume Driver for Kubernetes](operators/hpe-flexvolume-operator)

The Operator is also available on [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/operator/hpe-csi-operator).

## DIY with your CO of choice

We provide the [raw YAML files](yaml) to deploy the [HPE CSI Driver](https://github.com/hpe-storage/csi-driver) with the respective [Container Storage Provider](https://github.com/hpe-storage/container-storage-provider) (CSP). These files are usually referenced elsewhere on how to get a particular setup up and running. We recommend using the [Helm charts](helm/charts) first and foremost.

- YAML files for the [HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes](yaml/csi-driver)
- YAML files for the [HPE FlexVolume Driver for Kubernetes](yaml/flexvolume-driver)

How to perform an [advanced manual install](https://scod.hpedev.io/csi_driver/deployment.html#advanced_install) of the CSI driver.
